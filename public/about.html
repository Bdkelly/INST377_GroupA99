                <h1>Who?</h1>
                    <p>We are a group of five undergraduate students that attend UMD and major in Information Science. All of us have used the bus transportation system provided by the university 
                        at one point or another. We have also each seen and used applications which are made to assist individuals in planning/finding bus routes which go from one area to another.
                        However, we also have seen how cluttered and confusing these applications can be. As Information Science majors, we have experience with subjects such as UX (User Experience) 
                        design, human-computer interaction, and web applications. Due to our knowledge of these subjects, we feel that we will be able to create an application that gives users a 
                        streamlined, easy-to-use, and enjoyable experience.

                <h1>Why?</h1>
                    <p>The main problem we want to address is how confusing it can be to navigate the UMD bus system. Although there are other applications which attempt to solve this problem, some
                        of them can be somewhat unintuitive and difficult to use by users. Due to this, we wanted to build an application that is simple, intuitive, and extremely user-friendly, so
                        that any kind of user will be able to quickly and effortlessly find a bus that brings them from one location to another.
                    </p>
                <h1>How?</h1>
                    <p>In order to create an intuitive application, our group spent a considerable amount of time brainstorming ideas ideas and seeing whether or not they would be beneficial to
                        users. By doing this, we were able to ensure that the application has no clutter and is straightforward and simple to use while at the same time giving individuals all the
                        information they may need. For our application, all the user needs to do is enter in the address of their current location as well as their destination address. This is further
                        made easier by a button that allows the user to send their current location information. In return, our application shows the user information concerning buses and bus routes
                        such as the location of bus stops, estimated time of arrival, and bus number. Furthermore, in order to ensure that our application is user driven we will be taking into
                        consideration any and all feedback that might further improve usability and functionality.
